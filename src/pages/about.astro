    <div>
      <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">About Me</h1>

      <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
        Computer Science Engineer specialized in Information Systems from the
        University of Málaga, focused on data analysis and the transformation of
        information into actionable knowledge to support decision-making.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
        I work with data analysis tools and technologies such as Python, SQL,
        Spark, Power BI, Tableau, and cloud environments like Azure, applying
        them to data processing, analysis, and data visualization. My
        engineering background provides a solid foundation in mathematics,
        statistics, and logical reasoning to approach complex problems in a
        structured way.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
        I am driven by curiosity to understand the underlying reasons behind
        data, critical thinking to question conclusions, and the ability to turn
        technical analyses into clear and meaningful stories through effective
        communication focused on value.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
        I enjoy working in team environments and collaborating with diverse
        profiles, maintaining a constant attitude of learning, perseverance, and
        professional growth in real-world, data-oriented projects.

        I am seeking a stable full-time position that involves responsibility
        and continuous learning, and I am not interested in internships,
        training contracts, master’s programs, or doctoral studies, as my
        priority is professional growth within a company and delivering value in
        a real production environment.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
        I am particularly motivated by roles that combine data analysis,
        visualization, and communication, as well as by technological
        environments where information is used to support decision-making and
        improve products, processes, or services.

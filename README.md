# Personal Portfolio (v2)

This repository contains the second iteration of my personal portfolio, currently under active development.

The objective of this project is to redesign my portfolio from scratch using a modern, performant, and maintainable web stack, aligned with a data-oriented and engineering-focused professional profile.

## Tech Stack

- **Astro** – Static site framework focused on performance, SEO, and clean architecture
- **TypeScript** – Type safety and scalable development
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first styling for a consistent and maintainable design system
- **React (optional)** – Used only for isolated interactive components where it adds real value

The site is primarily built as a static application, prioritizing speed, accessibility, and simplicity.

## Project Goals

- Build a fast, accessible, and professional personal portfolio
- Clearly communicate my technical profile and career focus
- Apply good software engineering and frontend best practices
- Keep the codebase clean, readable, and easy to evolve

## Content Overview

- Professional profile and experience
- Technologies, tools, and certifications
- Selected projects (including my Final Degree Project)
- Downloadable CV and external links
- Multilingual support (English / Spanish)

## Deployment

The portfolio will be deployed via **GitHub Pages** once this version is completed.  
The current live portfolio will remain unchanged until the new version is ready.

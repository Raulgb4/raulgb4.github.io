# Personal Portfolio (v2)

This repository contains the second version of my personal portfolio, currently under development.

The goal of this project is to redesign my portfolio from scratch using a modern, performant, and maintainable web stack, aligned with a data-oriented and engineering-focused professional profile.

## Tech Stack

- **Astro** – Static site framework focused on performance and clean architecture
- **TypeScript** – Type safety and scalable code structure
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first styling for a clean and consistent design
- **React (optional)** – Used only for isolated interactive components if needed (e.g. charts or dynamic UI)

The portfolio is primarily built as a static site. React is intentionally kept optional and will only be introduced where it adds clear value.

## Project Goals

- Create a modern, fast, and professional personal portfolio
- Clearly present my technical profile with a focus on data, cloud, and software engineering
- Apply good development practices learned through academic and professional projects
- Keep the codebase simple, readable, and easy to maintain

## Planned Content

- Professional summary
- Technologies and tools
- Featured projects (including my Final Degree Project)
- Certifications and downloadable resources
- Links to GitHub and LinkedIn
- Multilingual support (English / Spanish)

## Deployment

The site will be deployed using **GitHub Pages** once the new version is completed.  
The current production portfolio remains unchanged until this version is finished.

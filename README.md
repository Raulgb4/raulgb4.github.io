# Personal Portfolio (v2)

This repository contains the second and current version of my personal portfolio website.

The project has been fully redesigned and rebuilt from scratch using a modern, performant, and maintainable web stack, with a strong focus on data-oriented thinking, software engineering practices, and clarity of communication.

The portfolio serves both as a professional presentation and as a demonstration of how I approach frontend architecture, performance, accessibility, and internationalization.

## Tech Stack

- **Astro** – Static site framework optimized for performance, SEO, and clean architecture
- **TypeScript** – Strong typing for reliability and scalable development
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first styling for a consistent and maintainable design system
- **React (optional)** – Used only for isolated interactive components where it provides clear value

The site is built primarily as a static application, prioritizing speed, accessibility, and simplicity.

## Project Goals

- Deliver a fast, accessible, and professional personal portfolio
- Clearly communicate my technical profile and career focus
- Apply solid software engineering and frontend best practices
- Maintain a clean, readable, and easy-to-evolve codebase

## Content Overview

- Professional profile and background
- Work experience and academic background
- Technologies, tools, and technical stack
- Certifications and continuous learning
- Selected projects (including my Final Degree Project)
- Contact information and external profiles
- Multilingual support (English / Spanish)

## Deployment

The portfolio is deployed using **GitHub Pages** and built as a fully static site via Astro.

It uses a language-prefixed routing structure (`/en`, `/es`) and includes SEO best practices such as:
- Canonical URLs
- Language alternates (`hreflang`)
- Open Graph and Twitter metadata
- Sitemap generation
